### Summary
I was a little nervous about this week's assignment, but I'm pretty happy with the result. It starts with a simple message: Draw. The click of the mouse yields thousands of multi-colored dots on a white background that begin to look like a mess of ants on the ground. As the process goes on, a black slate wipes the canvas clean, and the dots begin to look like city lights on a dark globe. Then the screen is wiped with white and the process begins again.

### Process
I think my submission last week broached into this "array of objects" realm, so a lot of it wasn't totally new. It was super helpful to learn the terminology and additional applications, though. Last week, I got an idea in my head and kind of bullheadedly muddled through on my own.

### Issues
Not many issues this week. Lots of trial and error and second-guessing, but I finally had to settle on an idea.

### Triumphs
I like that this is almost totally self-contained, but it requires interaction on the part of the viewer to get started. I'm not in love with technicalities of the canvas reset, but I like that it starts anew regularly.

### Future
I'm feeling good heading into the last weeks. I know there's a ton of material I probably need to practice, but my last two assignments have been pretty smooth, and I feel good about that.

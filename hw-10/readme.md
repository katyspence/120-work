## Homework 10

[Improved Snowman Sketch](https://katyspence.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)

### Summary
I submitted this week's assignment late due to being out of the country. I didn't change as much as I wanted, but I'm incredibly proud of figuring out how to get the snow to work.

### Process
I feel pretty good about this week's work. I feel like I'm still struggling a little in understanding and creating totally original material, but I'm doing well finding lots of examples and adapting bits and pieces to my own purpose. This week, I relied on a lot of the P% website material, but I also had to do tons of trial and error before I got what I wanted.

### Issues
Just tons of trial and error and hairpulling over the last couple of days. But it made victory all the sweeter.

### Triumphs
I got the freaking snow to fall, and I have so many ideas for application of this. I'm really excited about it, even if I recycled my totally lame snowman from earlier in the semester.

### Future
I still need to catch up on Week 11, but I'm feeling optimistic about it now.

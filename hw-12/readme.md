## Homework 12

[Live Sketch](https://katyspence.github.io/120-work/hw-12/)

### Summary
I made changes to the touching ball sketch and added a little more visual interest.

### Process
Since I've had a bad habit of overthinking some of these sketches, this week I went through the lessons and adapted one of the examples.

### Issues
There were a couple of bits I couldn't get to work like I wanted- I would have preferred that the balls cycle through the full rgb scale when they touch, but it wouldn't adjust from grayscale. So I added some pops of color and called it good.

### Triumphs
I finished my last coding assignment. Hurray!

### Future
If I come back to coding in the future, I think I'll definitely need to attend a live class. I don't absorb information as well in online classes, so I feel like I didn't get as much out of this as a could have. I need that accountability and ability to work with the professor and other people in the class.

However, this has been a great introduction to coding, and I am definitely not shutting the door on it as a future skill.

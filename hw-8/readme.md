## Homework 8

### Summary
Rough week going into an absent week, so I'm going to try to come visit in a couple of weeks for some guidance.

### Process
I went through the lessons and had a hard time applying what was presented in them. If I copy/pasted code, it would work, but when I tried to type it out from the beginning or adapt it, I would have problems. But those are more for the issues section.

Long story short, I went through the lessons and tried to apply the material I encountered without much success.

### Issues
I'm not understanding a lot of the concepts lately. I think I need to come in and just chat about them.

My big issue this week actually revolved around the openness of the lesson. I am having just a hell of a time coming up with my own concepts or art that are within my coding grasp. It was really a struggle today.

On top of that, I kept trying what I thought were new and ambitious applications to absolutely no avail. I don't know if it's because we haven't learned how to integrate some of the concepts yet, or if I just don't know how to apply them. In any case, I am feeling pressed for time and opted for a simpler approach. I'm not entirely proud of it, but it works.

### Triumphs?
I'm turning something in, and at this point, that feels better than nothing.

### Future
I will be out of the country starting on Friday, so I think I will have a lot of catching up to do when I get back. I'd like to come in and talk about some of the more recent lessons because I'm just having a really hard time.
